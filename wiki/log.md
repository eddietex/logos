## [2026-08-24] ingest | Genesis 1.1-2.3 — The Creation of the World

First ingest. Fetched the full WEB text of Genesis (50 chapters, 1533 verses) into
`raw/bible/Genesis.md` via the new `scripts/fetch-book.sh`, which pulls a book chapter-by-chapter
from bible-api.com.

Created:
- `wiki/books/Genesis.md` — book page with a proposed 58-pericope breakdown
  (`pericopes_confirmed: false` pending the user's sign-off)
- `wiki/passages/Genesis/Genesis 1.1-2.3 - The Creation of the World.md`
- `wiki/people/God.md`
- `wiki/themes/Creation.md`, `Image of God.md`, `Blessing.md`, `Sabbath.md`
- `wiki/connections/In the Beginning - Genesis 1 and John 1.md`
- `wiki/connections/Creation as the Ground of the Sabbath Command.md`

Updated: `wiki/index.md` counts, `wiki/books/index.md` (Genesis → in-progress), and the people,
themes, and connections indexes.

Schema changes made in the same pass: `templates/book.md` gained a `## Pericopes` checklist (the
ingestion queue) and a `pericopes_confirmed` frontmatter flag, replacing the old separate
outline/passage lists; `CLAUDE.md` documents the queue, the fetch script, and the new
`/ingest` skill.

Deliberately-unresolved links left for later pericopes: `[[Adam]]`, `[[Eve]]`, `[[Eden]]`.

Open question flagged on `[[Creation as the Ground of the Sabbath Command]]`: Exodus 20 grounds
the Sabbath in creation, Deuteronomy 5 in the exodus — two rationales for one command, held side
by side rather than harmonized.

## [2026-08-24] schema | Pericope breakdowns no longer need the user's sign-off

Reverses the confirmation gate introduced with the entry above, before it ever fired a second
time. The agent now draws each book's pericope breakdown on its own authority and keeps
ingesting in the same invocation; unchecked boxes in a book page's `## Pericopes` list are
provisional and may be revised by either the user (in Obsidian) or the agent (when the text
divides differently than the plan assumed). Checked boxes are settled, since a passage page
exists behind each.

Rationale: at one stop per book the gate would have interrupted 66 times over the canon to
approve boundaries that are cheap to fix after the fact.

Changes: `pericopes_confirmed` dropped from `templates/book.md` and `wiki/books/Genesis.md`;
step 3 of the `/ingest` skill no longer stops; `CLAUDE.md`'s "Ingestion unit: pericope" section
and the README's ingesting section rewritten to match. Genesis's 58-pericope breakdown, which
was awaiting sign-off, is now simply live.

## [2026-08-24] schema | Passage pages named by title alone

Passage filenames drop the book and verse reference: `Genesis 1.1-2.3 - The Creation of the
World.md` → `The Creation of the World.md`. The folder supplies the book, the `ref:` frontmatter
supplies the verses, and links now read as prose — `[[The Creation of the World]]`. The passage
page's H1 is the bare title too (the `**Reference:**` line under it already carries the ref), and
`templates/passage.md` matches.

Uniqueness, which the old prefix guaranteed for free, is now handled on collision: when a second
book wants a title that is already taken, both pages become `<Title> (<Book>).md` — e.g. `The
Transfiguration (Matthew)` and `The Transfiguration (Mark)` — with the existing page renamed and
its inbound links fixed in the same pass. Genesis has no internal collisions; the Gospels and
Kings/Chronicles will hit this often. `/lint` now checks for unqualified duplicate titles, since
an ambiguous `[[Title]]` resolves silently to just one page.

Ordering note: the file explorer sorts alphabetically, and creation time is filesystem metadata
that git does not carry, so neither gives canonical order. The book page's `## Pericopes`
checklist is the ordered table of contents — its entries are now uniformly `<Title> — <Ref>`,
title first, matching the filenames.

Changes: the one existing passage page renamed and all 11 inbound wikilinks updated (this log's
earlier entry keeps the old path, being a record of what happened then); naming conventions and
the lint checklist in `CLAUDE.md`; step 4 of the `/ingest` skill; `templates/passage.md` and
`templates/book.md`; all 58 queue entries in `wiki/books/Genesis.md`.
